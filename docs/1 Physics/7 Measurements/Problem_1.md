Discussion on Uncertainties and Sources of Error
Measurement resolution: The length uncertainty is very small due to fine ruler resolution; thus its contribution to uncertainty is minimal.

Timing variability: Human reaction time and stopwatch resolution dominate timing uncertainty. Taking average over 10 oscillations reduces error.

Assumptions:

Small angle approximation (<15°) to ensure 
𝑇
=
2
𝜋
𝐿
/
𝑔
T=2π 
L/g
​
  holds.

Neglecting air resistance and frictional losses.

Assuming the string is massless and rigid.

Limitations:

Timing by hand introduces random errors.

Environmental factors (air currents, vibrations) may affect results.

Length measured from suspension to center of mass of weight; error if not centered precisely.

Comparison with Standard Value
Standard 
𝑔
g at sea level = 9.80665 m/s².

Measured value: 
9.828
±
0.013
9.828±0.013 m/s² is close, within uncertainty range.

Slight difference may arise from local variations in 
𝑔
g or systematic errors.
